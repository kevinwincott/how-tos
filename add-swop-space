For Adding a 512 MiB swap

    Creating a file for 512 MiB size you want:

We will create a /mnt/512MiB.swap swap file and set the permissions so that users cannot read it directly.

sudo fallocate -l 512m /mnt/512MiB.swap
sudo chmod 600 /mnt/512MiB.swap

fallocate length suffixes are: k, m, g, t, p, e (See man fallocate).

By default your swap file may be created world readable. We set the 600 mode permissions in order to prevent users from being able to read potentially sensitive information from the swap file.

If fallocate fails with "fallocate failed: Operation not supported" as it currently does on my Maverick machine, you can do this the old way, again 512 mebibytes:

sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/512MiB.swap bs=1024 count=524288
sudo chmod 600 /mnt/512MiB.swap

    Formatting that file to create a swapping device:

sudo mkswap /mnt/512MiB.swap

    Adding the swap to the running system:

sudo swapon /mnt/512MiB.swap

The additional swap is now available and can be seen by "cat /proc/meminfo"

    Making the change permanent:

Edit the /etc/fstab:

gksudo gedit /etc/fstab

Add this line at the end of the file:

/mnt/512MiB.swap  none  swap  sw  0 0

Save. After the next reboot the swap will be used automatically.
